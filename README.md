# MichiganParkAndRide
Michigan Department of Transportation Carpool Lot Program 

I downloaded MDOT carpool lot data from: 
http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mdot::mdot-carpool-lots 

MDOT region data from:
http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mdot::mdot-regions

I then unzipped the MDOT_Regions.zip with the following command:
``` unzip MDOT_Regions-shp.zip -d MDOT-Regions ```

I inspected the MDOT_Regions.shp file by utilizing:
``` mapshaper MDOT_Regions.shp -info ```

To filter the shapefile down to only the desired attributes I used the following command:
``` mapshaper MDOT_Regions.shp -filter-fields Code,Name,OfficeCity -simplify dp 15% -o precision=.0001 format=geojson ../../data/mdot-regions.json ``` 

Ran app.js script to pull Earth color palette from CARTOColors.

Installed csv2geojson in order to parse park and ride lot locations (downloaded from MDOT in CSV format) to JSON.

I used QGIS to run a point in polygon function in order to determine carpool lot count within each MDOT region.
